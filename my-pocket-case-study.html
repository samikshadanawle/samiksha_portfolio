        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a personal project where I designed a My Pocket App Case Study to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks and to-do lists.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Many existing My Pocket App Case Study are cluttered and lack intuitive navigation, making it difficult for users to stay organized and prioritize their tasks.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Although no formal user research was conducted, I analyzed popularMy Pocket App Case Study to identify common pain points and areas for improvement.</p>

        <h2>Personas and User Journey</h2>
        <p>I created a persona representing a busy professional who needs a simple and efficient way to manage their tasks. The user journey map highlighted the process of adding, prioritizing, and completing tasks.</p>

        <h2>Ideation and Sketching</h2>
        <p>I brainstormed various design solutions and created initial sketches to explore different layouts and features.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes and Prototypes</h2>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>The design focused on a clean and minimalistic interface with easy navigation. Key features included task categorization, due dates, and priority levels.</p>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project helped me understand the importance of simplicity in design. In the future, I would like to add collaborative features and integrations with calendar applications.</p>
